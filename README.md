## üßë About Me

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I enjoy taking walks in the city center, watching the world go by and observing people. Music is a big part of my life - I love progressive psytrance and metal. Computers fascinate me, and I'm interested in technology.

As for dislikes, I'm not a fan of traveling or long car rides. I'm skeptical about electric cars like Teslas - the idea of computers on wheels doesn't sit well with me. TVs are another no-go; the constant audio makes me feel sick and tired.

## ü™ô Support

I use Monero, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency. If you'd like, you can donate to my Monero address:
